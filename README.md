This is my SBA capstone project for the HTMLL/CSS modules in the Per Scholas full stack dev program. We also covered some Bootstrap. Some minimal Bootstrap was included in this project.

The technical requirements are as follows:

---HTML Requirements---
Have at least three pages.
Keep the grid system consistent between pages as much as possible.
Use at least ten different HTML tags.
Include at least one table.
Include at least two forms.
Include at least one dropdown menu.
Include at least one of each of the following forms of content: 
Text.
Images.
GIFs.


---CSS Requirements---
Make use of inline, internal, and external styling.
Use five different CSS selectors.
Use colors that complement each other.
Coolors is one of many resources that can help you find a color palette.
Use Flexbox and/or the Bootstrap Grid.
Use at least two CSS animations.
